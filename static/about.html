    <h1>About the songlist</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>As this is a simple project for the use of a few friends, I
        haven't really focused on security or safeguards.  I really rely
        on the presumption that people will use the tool sensibly - so
        please do.  Only add songs you actually like and think others
        would like to hear, and please don't remove songs others have
        added without their permission.</li>
        <li>URL and song name / title are required fields (because a-ya
        doesn't want to listen to your gangsta shite).  Other info is
        for anything else you want to say about the song - genre, mood,
        what the song means to you, etc.  Other info is an optional
        field.  Submitter name is your nick; it is also optional, but it
        would be nice to know who is submitting.  Also, if you do add
        your name, keep it consistent (eg, bunburya, and not bunburya_)
        so in the future I can add search functionality.  All fields are
        limited to 250 chars; if you think this is too short, let me
        know.</li>
        <li>If you are in a channel where bunbot resides, you can
        interact with the songlist using the following commands:
            <ul>
                <li><code>!add_song <url> <song name and title></code>
                to add a song; and</li>
                <li><code>!random_song</code> to fetch a random song
                from the list.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>To avoid duplicate submissions, submitting a URL that has
        been submitted before will silently delete the old submission.
        </li>
        <li>Remember that this page is technically accessible by anyone
        so don't put anything up here you wouldn't want the world to
        see.  Of course I disclaim any responsibility for anything
        other people put on this page.</li>
        <li>If you have any comments, requests or problems, just let me
        know on IRC.  Thanks!</li>
    </ul>
