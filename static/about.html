    <h1>About the song list</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>As this is a simple project for the use of a few friends, I
        haven't really focused on security or safeguard.  I really rely
        on the presumption that people will use the tool sensibly - so
        please do.  Only add songs you actually like and think others
        would like to hear, and please don't remove songs others have
        added without their permission.</li>
        <li>URL and song name / title are required fields (because a-ya
        doesn't want to listen to your gangsta shite).  Other info is
        for anything else you want to say about the song - genre, mood,
        what the song means to you, etc.  Other info is an optional
        field.  Submitter name is your nick; it is also optional, but it
        would be nice to know who is submitting.  Also, if you do add
        your name, keep it consistent (eg, bunburya, and not bunburya_)
        so in the future I can add search functionality.  All field are
        limited to 250 chars; if you think this is too short, let me
        know.</li>
        <li>There is a simple POST API, eventually I will document it
        but in the meantime let me know if you want to know more about
        it.</li>
        <li>Coming soon: bunbot integration and RSS.</li>
        <li>Remember that this page is technically accessible by anyone
        so don't put anything up here you wouldn't want the world to
        see.  Of course I disclaim any responsibility for anything
        other people put on this page.</li>
        <li>Yeah it doesn't look good, BUT NEITHER DO YOU.  If someone
        wants to do up a nice stylesheet I would consider integrating
        it, but really does it matter?</li>
        <li>If you have any comments, requests or problems, just let me
        know on IRC.  Thanks!</li>
    </ul>
